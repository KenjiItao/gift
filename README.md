# Transition of Social Organizations through Gift Relations
Source Code of Itao, K., Kaneko, K. 



## Simulation Model
We build a simple model of social networks which grow by the gift interactions of nodes. With evolutionary simulation, various social organizations, including bands, tribes, and chiefdoms, emerge depending on the frequency of gift.

See [gift.py](gift.py) for details.

## Data analysis
We also conducted empirical data analysis using the ethnographic database, Standard Cross-Cultural Sample.
See [gift_SCCS_stat.py](gift_SCCS_stat.p) for details.
